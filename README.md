# Variational Autoencoder for Genetic Sequence Data
* This project contains Python scripts to build and train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for genetic sequence data. The purpose of this model is to generate new sequences that are similar to the training data. The VAE model has two main parts: an encoder, which maps the input data into a latent space, and a decoder, which reconstructs the input data from the latent space representation.

## Software Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Biopython: a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python.
* numpy: a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions.
* Keras: a high-level neural networks API capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
* Scikit-learn and TensorFlow

## Installation
* Before running the scripts, you need to have the necessary Python libraries. You can install these libraries using pip: ``` pip install biopython numpy keras scikit-learn tensorflow```

## Model Architecture
* The VAE model is defined and compiled in VAE.py. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder transforms the input sequences into a lower-dimensional latent space. The decoder then reconstructs the input sequences from the latent space representation.
* The encoder and decoder are connected in such a way that the model can be trained end-to-end to minimize the reconstruction error and a divergence measure between the distribution of the latent space and a standard normal distribution.

## Data Preparation
* Please download SARS2 sequences from GISAID (https://gisaid.org/).

## Training
* The VAE model is trained on the encoded sequence data. The model learns to encode the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decode the latent space representation back into the original data. The objective is to minimize the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data.
* The training process is performed in the script VAE.py. This script loads the one-hot encoded sequence data, compiles the VAE model, and trains it on the sequence data.

## Usage
* ``` python VAE.py ```: Run VAE.py to create and train the VAE model on your preprocessed data. You can adjust the parameters of the model and the training process as needed. This code, eventually, will generate simulated sequences.

## Notes
* The latent space of the VAE model is a continuous space that the model learns to map the input sequences to. By sampling points from this space, we can generate new sequences that are similar to the training data.
* The performance of the VAE model can be influenced by various factors such as the complexity of the sequence data, the dimensionality of the latent space, and the architecture of the encoder and decoder networks.

## This repo and code were generated by ChatGPT for proof of concept. Here are some tips.
### How to use ChatGPT: ChatGPT can be used as a tool to assist with sequence classification tasks in a few different ways:
* Problem Understanding: If you're new to sequence classification, you can use ChatGPT to get an overview of the field and understand its key concepts.
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: ChatGPT can help generate Python code or other scripting language code for data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Model Selection and Tuning: ChatGPT can help with understanding the different types of models that are suitable for sequence classification, and it can assist with generating code for implementing these models.
* Interpreting Results: Once you have your model's results, ChatGPT can help explain what these results mean and assist with troubleshooting any issues.

### When not to use ChatGPT: While ChatGPT can be very useful, there are situations where it may not be the best tool:
* Complex Problem-Solving: While ChatGPT can provide explanations and generate code, it's not currently capable of independently solving complex sequence classification problems.
* Real-Time Support: Depending on your API access and rate limits, you may not be able to get real-time support for issues.
* Deep Technical Insights: While ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI with a wide range of knowledge, it may not be able to provide the depth of technical insight that a human expert in sequence classification could provide.

### How to live with ChatGPT: If you're using ChatGPT regularly, here are a few tips to keep in mind:
* Understand its limitations: Remember that while ChatGPT can provide useful information and assist with many tasks, it's not perfect and its knowledge is up-to-date only up to its last training cut-off, which is September 2021.
* Maintain security and privacy: When asking questions or providing information to ChatGPT, be mindful of your privacy and security. Avoid sharing sensitive personal information with the model.

### What is the real cost of AI? The costs of using AI, including models like ChatGPT, can include:
* Monetary Costs: Depending on your usage, you may need to pay for API access to ChatGPT. Building, training, and deploying your own AI models can also be quite costly in terms of hardware and cloud computing costs.
* Time and Resources: It can take considerable time and resources to properly integrate AI into your workflow, including time spent learning how to use the technology and adapting it to your needs.
* Data and Privacy Considerations: Using AI can often involve collecting and processing large amounts of data, which can have privacy implications and requires careful data management.
* Ethical Considerations: There can be ethical considerations associated with using AI, including concerns about bias in AI models and their potential impact on decision-making processes.
